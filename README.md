# Vanna AI - Database Agent Framework

This project is built upon **Vanna AI**, a powerful framework designed to function as an intelligent **database agent**, integrated with SQL databases. Developed during my internship with **Exquitech**, this project aimed to provide a seamless interaction between natural language queries and structured databases, making data retrieval simpler and more efficient.

## Project Overview

Vanna AI serves as a framework that bridges the gap between human language and database systems. It enables users to query SQL databases using natural language, automatically converting these queries into optimized SQL statements. The framework is designed to handle complex data interactions, providing accurate and relevant results with minimal user input.

### Key Features:
- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can interact with databases using everyday language, which the framework converts into SQL queries.
- **SQL Database Integration**: Fully integrated with SQL databases, supporting a wide range of queries, from simple SELECT statements to more complex joins and aggregations.
- **AI-Powered Query Optimization**: Utilizes **Generative AI** and **Langchain** to understand and optimize user queries, providing efficient and relevant responses.
- **Vector-Based Search**: Leverages **FAISS** and **ChromaDB** for enhanced vector-based retrieval, improving the accuracy of query results by using semantic search methods.
- **Generative AI Models**: Integrated with **Azure OpenAI LLMs** (like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) to power the query understanding and generation process, ensuring precise SQL query formation.
  
### Technology Stack:
- **Python**: For core framework development and query processing.
- **Langchain Framework**: To enable AI-powered language processing and query conversion.
- **Vector Stores (FAISS, ChromaDB)**: For efficient search and retrieval.
- **SQL Databases**: Fully integrated to support structured data operations.

This project, developed with the support of **Exquitech**, highlights the power of combining AI with traditional database systems, offering a solution that simplifies database interaction for users, while maintaining robust query performance and scalability.
